# Zig Date

At the present moment it's just a not really functional GregorianDateTime, but will, hopefully, be a fully functional Gregorian calendar date time.

It already supports formatting documented in `date.zig:200` or `format` function of `DateTime` struct. There were some problems with zig's `std.fmt.format` so you can't format in `std.debug.print` yet

No tests were written for now, but will soon be added
